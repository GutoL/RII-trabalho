    "paper_abstract": "In recent years researchers have achieved considerable success applying\nneural network methods to question answering (QA). These approaches have\nachieved state of the art results in simplified closed-domain settings such as\nthe SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) dataset, which provides a pre-selected\npassage, from which the answer to a given question may be extracted. More\nrecently, researchers have begun to tackle open-domain QA, in which the model\nis given a question and access to a large corpus (e.g., wikipedia) instead of a\npre-selected passage (Chen et al., 2017a). This setting is more complex as it\nrequires large-scale search for relevant passages by an information retrieval\ncomponent, combined with a reading comprehension model that \"reads\" the\npassages to generate an answer to the question. Performance in this setting\nlags considerably behind closed-domain performance.\n<br />In this paper, we present a novel open-domain QA system called Reinforced\nRanker-Reader $(R^3)$, based on two algorithmic innovations. First, we propose\na new pipeline for open-domain QA with a Ranker component, which learns to rank\nretrieved passages in terms of likelihood of generating the ground-truth answer\nto a given question. Second, we propose a novel method that jointly trains the\nRanker along with an answer-generation Reader model, based on reinforcement\nlearning. We report extensive experimental results showing that our method\nsignificantly improves on the state of the art for multiple open-domain QA\ndatasets.",
