    "paper_abstract": "As a firm varies the price of a product, consumers exhibit reference effects,\nmaking purchase decisions based not only on the prevailing price but also the\nproduct's price history. We consider the problem of learning such behavioral\npatterns as a monopolist releases, markets, and prices products. This context\ncalls for pricing decisions that intelligently trade off between maximizing\nrevenue generated by a current product and probing to gain information for\nfuture benefit. Due to dependence on price history, realized demand can reflect\ndelayed consequences of earlier pricing decisions. As such, inference entails\nattribution of outcomes to prior decisions and effective exploration requires\nplanning price sequences that yield informative future outcomes. Despite the\nconsiderable complexity of this problem, we offer a tractable systematic\napproach. In particular, we frame the problem as one of reinforcement learning\nand leverage Thompson sampling. We also establish a regret bound that provides\ngraceful guarantees on how performance improves as data is gathered and how\nthis depends on the complexity of the demand model. We illustrate merits of the\napproach through simulations.",
