    "paper_abstract": "We report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of a quantum\nspeed-up for learning agents utilizing a small-scale quantum information\nprocessor based on radiofrequency-driven trapped ions. The decision-making\nprocess of a quantum learning agent within the projective simulation paradigm\nfor machine learning is modeled in a system of two qubits. The latter are\nrealized in the hyperfine levels of two frequency-addressed ions exposed to a\nstatic magnetic field gradient. The deliberation algorithm is implemented using\nsingle-qubit rotations and two-qubit conditional quantum dynamics. We show that\nthe deliberation time of this quantum learning agent is quadratically improved\nwith respect to comparable classical learning agents. The performance of this\nquantum-enhanced learning agent highlights the potential of scalable ion trap\nquantum processors taking advantage of machine learning.",
