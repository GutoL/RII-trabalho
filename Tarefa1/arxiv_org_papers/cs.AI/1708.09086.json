    "paper_abstract": "Knowing where people live is a fundamental component of many decision making\nprocesses such as urban development, infectious disease containment, evacuation\nplanning, risk management, conservation planning, and more. While bottom-up,\nsurvey driven censuses can provide a comprehensive view into the population\nlandscape of a country, they are expensive to realize, are infrequently\nperformed, and only provide population counts over broad areas. Population\ndisaggregation techniques and population projection methods individually\naddress these shortcomings, but also have shortcomings of their own. To jointly\nanswer the questions of \"where do people live\" and \"how many people live\nthere,\" we propose a deep learning model for creating high-resolution\npopulation estimations from satellite imagery. Specifically, we train\nconvolutional neural networks to predict population in the USA at a\n$0.01^{\\circ} \\times 0.01^{\\circ}$ resolution grid from 1-year composite\nLandsat imagery. We validate these models in two ways: quantitatively, by\ncomparing our model's grid cell estimates aggregated at a county-level to\nseveral US Census county-level population projections, and qualitatively, by\ndirectly interpreting the model's predictions in terms of the satellite image\ninputs. We find that aggregating our model's estimates gives comparable results\nto the Census county-level population projections and that the predictions made\nby our model can be directly interpreted, which give it advantages over\ntraditional population disaggregation methods. In general, our model is an\nexample of how machine learning techniques can be an effective tool for\nextracting information from inherently unstructured, remotely sensed data to\nprovide effective solutions to social problems.",
