    "paper_abstract": "We extend the notion of anti-unification to cover equational theories and\npresent a method based on regular tree grammars to compute a finite\nrepresentation of E-generalization sets. We present a framework to combine\nInductive Logic Programming and E-generalization that includes an extension of\nPlotkin's lgg theorem to the equational case. We demonstrate the potential\npower of E-generalization by three example applications: computation of\nsuggestions for auxiliary lemmas in equational inductive proofs, computation of\nconstruction laws for given term sequences, and learning of screen editor\ncommand sequences.",
