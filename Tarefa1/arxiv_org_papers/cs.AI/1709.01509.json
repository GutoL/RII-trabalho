    "paper_abstract": "In this note, we point out a basic link between generative adversarial (GA)\ntraining and binary classification -- any powerful discriminator essentially\ncomputes an (f-)divergence between real and generated samples. The result,\nrepeatedly re-derived in decision theory, has implications for GA Networks\n(GANs), providing an alternative perspective on training f-GANs by designing\nthe discriminator loss function.",
