Using Bayesian-inspired\narguments we build a normative model of fair bets under deductive uncertainty\nwhich diverges from probability theory per se but draws on the theory of\nalgorithms. We comment on connections to Zeilberger's notion of \"semi-rigorous\nproofs\", particularly that inherent subjectivity is an obstacle.",
