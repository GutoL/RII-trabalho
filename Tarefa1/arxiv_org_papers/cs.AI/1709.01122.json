    "paper_abstract": "Probabilistic Inference Modulo Theories (PIMT) is a recent framework that\nexpands exact inference on graphical models to use richer languages that\ninclude arithmetic, equalities, and inequalities on both integers and real\nnumbers. In this paper, we expand PIMT to a lifted version that also processes\nrandom functions and relations. This enhancement is achieved by adapting\nInversion, a method from Lifted First-Order Probabilistic Inference literature,\nto also be modulo theories. This results in the first algorithm for exact\nprobabilistic inference that efficiently and simultaneously exploits random\nrelations and functions, arithmetic, equalities and inequalities.",
