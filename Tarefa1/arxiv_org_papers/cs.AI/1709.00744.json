In 2005 [<a href=\"/abs/1403.8118\">arXiv:1403.8118</a>], we had\npresented a computation approach based on standard regular tree grammar\nalgorithms, and a Prolog prototype implementation. In this report, we present\nalgorithmic improvements, prove them correct and complete, and give some\ndetails of an efficiency-oriented implementation in C that allows us to handle\nproblems larger by several orders of magnitude.",
