    "paper_abstract": "We investigate the non-identifiability issues associated with bidirectional\nadversarial training for joint distribution matching. Within a framework of\nconditional entropy, we propose both adversarial and non-adversarial approaches\nto learn desirable matched joint distributions for unsupervised and supervised\ntasks. We unify a broad family of adversarial models as joint distribution\nmatching problems. Our approach stabilizes learning of unsupervised\nbidirectional adversarial learning methods. Further, we introduce an extension\nfor semi-supervised learning tasks. Theoretical results are validated in\nsynthetic data and real-world applications.",
