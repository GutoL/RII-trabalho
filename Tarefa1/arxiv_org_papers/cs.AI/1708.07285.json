    "paper_abstract": "We address a problem of area protection in graph-based scenarios with\nmultiple agents. The problem consists of two adversarial teams of agents that\nmove in an undirected graph shared by both teams. Agents are placed in vertices\nof the graph; at most one agent can occupy a vertex; and they can move into\nadjacent vertices in a conflict free way. Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim\nof one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the\nopponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by\nattackers by occupying selected vertices. We study strategies for allocating\nvertices to be occupied by the team of defenders to block attacking agents. We\nshow that the decision version of the problem of area protection is PSPACE-hard\nunder the assumption that agents can allocate their target vertices multiple\ntimes. Further we develop various on-line vertex-allocation strategies for the\ndefender team in a simplified variant of the problem with single stage vertex\nallocation and evaluated their performance in multiple benchmarks. The success\nof a strategy is heavily dependent on the type of the instance, and so one of\nthe contributions of this work is that we identify suitable vertex-allocation\nstrategies for diverse instance types. In particular, we introduce a\nsimulation-based method that identifies and tries to capture bottlenecks in the\ngraph, that are frequently used by the attackers. Our experimental evaluation\nsuggests that this method often allows a successful defense even in instances\nwhere the attackers significantly outnumber the defenders.",
