    "paper_abstract": "Human understanding of narrative is mainly driven by reasoning about causal\nrelations between events and thus recognizing them is a key capability for\ncomputational models of language understanding. Computational work in this area\nhas approached this via two different routes: by focusing on acquiring a\nknowledge base of common causal relations between events, or by attempting to\nunderstand a particular story or macro-event, along with its storyline. In this\nposition paper, we focus on knowledge acquisition approach and claim that\nnewswire is a relatively poor source for learning fine-grained causal relations\nbetween everyday events. We describe experiments using an unsupervised method\nto learn causal relations between events in the narrative genres of\nfirst-person narratives and film scene descriptions. We show that our method\nlearns fine-grained causal relations, judged by humans as likely to be causal\nover 80% of the time. We also demonstrate that the learned event pairs do not\nexist in publicly available event-pair datasets extracted from newswire.",
