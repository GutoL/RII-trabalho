    "paper_abstract": "Fine-tuning of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is often desired.\nThis paper provides an overview of our publicly available py-faster-rcnn-ft\nsoftware library that can be used to fine-tune the VGG_CNN_M_1024 model on\ncustom subsets of the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset.\nFor example, we improved the procedure so that the user does not have to look\nfor suitable image files in the dataset by hand which can then be used in the\ndemo program. Our implementation randomly selects images that contain at least\none object of the categories on which the model is fine-tuned.",
