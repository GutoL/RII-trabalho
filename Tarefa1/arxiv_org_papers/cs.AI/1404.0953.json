    "paper_abstract": "We present an implementation of E-anti-unification as defined in Heinz\n(1995), where tree-grammar descriptions of equivalence classes of terms are\nused to compute generalizations modulo equational theories. We discuss several\nimprovements, including an efficient implementation of variable-restricted\nE-anti-unification from Heinz (1995), and give some runtime figures about them.\nWe present applications in various areas, including lemma generation in\nequational inductive proofs, intelligence tests, diverging Knuth-Bendix\ncompletion, strengthening of induction hypotheses, and theory formation about\nfinite algebras.",
