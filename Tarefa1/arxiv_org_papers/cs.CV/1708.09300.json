    "paper_abstract": "Automation of brain matter segmentation from MR images is a challenging task\ndue to the irregular boundaries between the grey and white matter regions. In\naddition, the presence of intensity inhomogeneity in the MR images further\ncomplicates the problem. In this paper, we propose a texture and vesselness\nincorporated version of the ScatterNet Hybrid Deep Learning Network (TS-SHDL)\nthat extracts hierarchical invariant mid-level features, used by fisher vector\nencoding and a conditional random field (CRF) to perform the desired\nsegmentation. The performance of the proposed network is evaluated by extensive\nexperimentation and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on several 2D\nMRI scans taken from the synthetic McGill Brain Web as well as on the MRBrainS\ndataset of real 3D MRI scans. The advantages of the TS-SHDL network over\nsupervised deep learning networks is also presented in addition to its superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art.",
