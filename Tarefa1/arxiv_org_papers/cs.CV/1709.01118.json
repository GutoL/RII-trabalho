    "paper_abstract": "Low-end and compact mobile cameras demonstrate limited photo quality mainly\ndue to space, hardware and budget constraints. In this work, we propose a deep\nlearning solution that translates photos taken by cameras with limited\ncapabilities into DSLR-quality photos automatically. We tackle this problem by\nintroducing a weakly supervised photo enhancer (WESPE) - a novel image-to-image\nGenerative Adversarial Network-based architecture. The proposed model is\ntrained by weakly supervised learning: unlike previous works, there is no need\nfor strong supervision in the form of a large annotated dataset of aligned\noriginal/enhanced photo pairs. The sole requirement is two distinct datasets:\none from the source camera, and one composed of arbitrary high-quality images\nthat can be generally crawled from the Internet - the visual content they\nexhibit may be unrelated. Hence, our solution is repeatable for any camera:\ncollecting the data and training can be achieved in a couple of hours. Our\nexperiments on the DPED, Kitti and Cityscapes datasets as well as pictures from\nseveral generations of smartphones demonstrate that WESPE produces comparable\nqualitative results with state-of-the-art strongly supervised methods, while\nnot requiring the tedious work to obtain aligned datasets.",
