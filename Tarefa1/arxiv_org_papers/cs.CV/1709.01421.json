    "paper_abstract": "Automatic analysis of the video is one of most complex problems in the fields\nof computer vision and machine learning. A significant part of this research\ndeals with (human) activity recognition (HAR) since humans, and the activities\nthat they perform, generate most of the video semantics. Video-based HAR has\napplications in various domains, but one of the most important and challenging\nis HAR in sports videos. Some of the major issues include high inter- and\nintra-class variations, large class imbalance, the presence of both group\nactions and single player actions, and recognizing simultaneous actions, i.e.,\nthe multi-label learning problem. Keeping in mind these challenges and the\nrecent success of CNNs in solving various computer vision problems, in this\nwork, we implement a 3D CNN based multi-label deep HAR system for multi-label\nclass-imbalanced action recognition in hockey videos. We test our system for\ntwo different scenarios: an ensemble of k binary networks vs. a single k-output\nnetwork, on a publicly available dataset. We also compare our results with the\nsystem that was originally designed for the chosen dataset. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach performs better than the existing\nsolution.",
