    "paper_abstract": "Face verification is a problem approached in the literature mainly using\nnonlinear class-specific subspace learning techniques. While it has been shown\nthat kernel-based Class-Specific Discriminant Analysis is able to provide\nexcellent performance in small- and medium-scale face verification problems,\nits application in today's large-scale problems is difficult due to its\ntraining space and computational requirements. In this paper, generalizing our\nprevious work on kernel-based class-specific discriminant analysis, we show\nthat class-specific subspace learning can be cast as a regression problem. This\nallows us to derive linear, (reduced) kernel and neural network-based\nclass-specific discriminant analysis methods using efficient batch and/or\niterative training schemes, suited for large-scale learning problems. We test\nthe performance of these methods in two datasets describing medium- and\nlarge-scale face verification problems.",
