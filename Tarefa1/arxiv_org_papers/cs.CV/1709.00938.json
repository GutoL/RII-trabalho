    "paper_abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in image-based plant\nphenotyping, applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to tackle\nchallenging problems, such as leaf segmentation (a multi-instance problem) and\ncounting. Most of these algorithms need labelled data to learn a model for the\ntask at hand. Despite the recent release of a few plant phenotyping datasets,\nlarge annotated plant image datasets for the purpose of training deep learning\nalgorithms are lacking. One common approach to alleviate the lack of training\ndata is dataset augmentation. Herein, we propose an alternative solution to\ndataset augmentation for plant phenotyping, creating artificial images of\nplants using generative neural networks. We propose the Arabidopsis Rosette\nImage Generator (through) Adversarial Network: a deep convolutional network\nthat is able to generate synthetic rosette-shaped plants, inspired by DCGAN (a\nrecent adversarial network model using convolutional layers). Specifically, we\ntrained the network using A1, A2, and A4 of the CVPPP 2017 LCC dataset,\ncontaining Arabidopsis Thaliana plants. We show that our model is able to\ngenerate realistic 128x128 colour images of plants. We train our network\nconditioning on leaf count, such that it is possible to generate plants with a\ngiven number of leaves suitable, among others, for training regression based\nmodels. We propose a new Ax dataset of artificial plants images, obtained by\nour ARIGAN. We evaluate this new dataset using a state-of-the-art leaf counting\nalgorithm, showing that the testing error is reduced when Ax is used as part of\nthe training data.",
