    "paper_abstract": "This paper studies the problem of reproducible research in remote\nphotoplethysmography (rPPG). Most of the work published in this domain is\nassessed on privately-owned databases, making it difficult to evaluate proposed\nalgorithms in a standard and principled manner. As a consequence, we present a\nnew, publicly available database containing a relatively large number of\nsubjects recorded under two different lighting conditions. Also, three\nstate-of-the-art rPPG algorithms from the literature were selected, implemented\nand released as open source free software. After a thorough, unbiased\nexperimental evaluation in various settings, it is shown that none of the\nselected algorithms is precise enough to be used in a real-world scenario.",
