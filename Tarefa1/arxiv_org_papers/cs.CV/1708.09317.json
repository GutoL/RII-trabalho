    "paper_abstract": "Disguised face identification (DFI) is an extremely challenging problem due\nto the numerous variations that can be introduced using different disguises.\nThis paper introduces a deep learning framework to first detect 14 facial\nkey-points which are then utilized to perform disguised face identification.\nSince the training of deep learning architectures relies on large annotated\ndatasets, two annotated facial key-points datasets are introduced. The\neffectiveness of the facial keypoint detection framework is presented for each\nkeypoint. The superiority of the key-point detection framework is also\ndemonstrated by a comparison with other deep networks. The effectiveness of\nclassification performance is also demonstrated by comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art face disguise classification methods.",
