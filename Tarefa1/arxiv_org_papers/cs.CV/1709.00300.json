    "paper_abstract": "Designing an e-commerce recommender system that serves hundreds of millions\nof active users is a daunting challenge. Ranking strategy as the key module\nneeds to be more carefully designed. We find two key factors that affect users'\nbehaviors: attractive item content and compatibility with users' interests. To\nextract these factors, a ranking model needs to understand users from a human\nvision perspective. This paper proposes Telepath, a vision-based architecture\nthat simulates the human vision system to extract the key visual signals that\nattract users to a displayed item and generate vision activations and simulates\ncerebral cortex to understand users' interest based on the captured activations\nfrom browsed items. Telepath is a combination of CNN, RNN and DNN. In practice,\nthe Telepath model has been launched to JD's online recommender system and\nadvertising system. For one of the major item recommendation blocks on the JD\napp, CTR, GMV and orders have increased 1.59%, 8.16% and 8.71% respectively.\nFor several major advertising publishers of JD DSP, CTR, GMV and ROI have\nincreased 6.58%, 61.72% and 65.57% respectively by the first launch, and\nfurther increased 2.95%, 41.75% and 41.37% respectively by the second launch.",
