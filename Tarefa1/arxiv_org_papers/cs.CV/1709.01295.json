    "paper_abstract": "The ability to semantically interpret hand-drawn line sketches, although very\nchallenging, can pave way for novel applications in multimedia. We propose\nSketchParse, the first deep-network architecture for fully automatic parsing of\nfreehand object sketches. SketchParse is configured as a two-level fully\nconvolutional network. The first level contains shared layers common to all\nobject categories. The second level contains a number of expert sub-networks.\nEach expert specializes in parsing sketches from object categories which\ncontain structurally similar parts. Effectively, the two-level configuration\nenables our architecture to scale up efficiently as additional categories are\nadded. We introduce a router layer which (i) relays sketch features from shared\nlayers to the correct expert (ii) eliminates the need to manually specify\nobject category during inference. To bypass laborious part-level annotation, we\nsketchify photos from semantic object-part image datasets and use them for\ntraining. Our architecture also incorporates object pose prediction as a novel\nauxiliary task which boosts overall performance while providing supplementary\ninformation regarding the sketch. We demonstrate SketchParse's abilities (i) on\ntwo challenging large-scale sketch datasets (ii) in parsing unseen,\nsemantically related object categories (iii) in improving fine-grained\nsketch-based image retrieval. As a novel application, we also outline how\nSketchParse's output can be used to generate caption-style descriptions for\nhand-drawn sketches.",
