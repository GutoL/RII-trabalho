    "paper_abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of land use and land cover\nclassification using remote sensing satellite images. For this challenging\ntask, we use the openly and freely accessible Sentinel-2 satellite images\nprovided within the scope of the Earth observation program Copernicus. The key\ncontributions are as follows. We present a novel dataset based on satellite\nimages covering 13 different spectral bands and consisting of 10 classes with\nin total 27,000 labeled images. We evaluate state-of-the-art deep Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNNs) on this novel dataset with its different spectral bands.\nWe also evaluate deep CNNs on existing remote sensing datasets and compare the\nobtained results. With the proposed novel dataset, we achieved an overall\nclassification accuracy of 98.57%. The classification system resulting from the\nproposed research opens a gate towards a number of Earth observation\napplications. We demonstrate how the classification system can be used for\ndetecting land use or land cover changes and how it can assist in improving\ngeographical maps.",
