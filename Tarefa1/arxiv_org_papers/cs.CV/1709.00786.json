    "paper_abstract": "Abundant accumulation of digital histopathological images has led to the\nincreased demand for their analysis, such as computer-aided diagnosis using\nmachine learning techniques. However, digital pathological images and related\ntasks have some issues to be considered. In this mini-review, we introduce the\napplication of digital pathological image analysis using machine learning\nalgorithms, address some problems specific to such analysis, and propose\npossible solutions.",
