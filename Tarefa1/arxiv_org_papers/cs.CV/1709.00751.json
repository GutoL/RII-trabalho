    "paper_abstract": "In conveyor belt sushi restaurants, billing is a burdened job because one has\nto manually count the number of dishes and identify the color of them to\ncalculate the price. In a busy situation, there can be a mistake that customers\nare overcharged or under-charged. To deal with this problem, we developed a\nmethod that automatically identifies the color of dishes and calculate the\ntotal price using real images. Our method consists of ellipse fitting and\nconvol-utional neural network. It achieves ellipse detection precision 85% and\nrecall 96% and classification accuracy 92%.",
