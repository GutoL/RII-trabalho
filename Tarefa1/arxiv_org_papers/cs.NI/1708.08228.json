Using the Isabelle interactive proof assistant, we develop\ntwo automated, formally verified tools which help uncovering and preventing\nbugs in network-level access control configurations. Our first tool guides the\nprocess of designing networks from scratch. Our second tool facilitates the\nanalysis of existing iptables configurations. Combined, the two form a powerful\ntoolset.",
