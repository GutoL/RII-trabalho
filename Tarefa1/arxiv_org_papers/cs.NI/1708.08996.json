    "paper_abstract": "The paper addresses the following problems: (1) a brief survey on wireless\nmobile communication technologies including evolution, history evolution (e.g.,\nchain of system generations 0G, 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, 6G, 7G); (2) using a\nhierarchical structural modular approach to the generations of the wireless\ncommunication systems (i.e., hierarchical combinatorial modeling of the\ncommunication technologies), (3) illustrative usage of two-stage combinatorial\napproach to improvement/forecasting of the communication technology (a version\nof 5G) (on the basis of multiple choice problem). Numerical examples illustrate\nthe suggested combinatorial approach.",
