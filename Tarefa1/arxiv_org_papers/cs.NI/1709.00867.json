    "paper_abstract": "A source traffic model for machine-to-machine communications is presented in\nthis paper. We consider a model in which devices operate in a regular mode\nuntil they are triggered into an alarm mode by an alarm event. The positions of\ndevices and events are modeled by means of Poisson point processes, where the\ngenerated traffic by a given device depends on its position and event\npositions. We first consider the case where devices and events are static and\ndevices generate traffic according to a Bernoulli process, where we derive the\ntotal rate from the devices at the base station. We then extend the model by\ndefining a two-state Markov chain for each device, which allows for devices to\nstay in alarm mode for a geometrically distributed holding time. The temporal\ncharacteristics of this model are analyzed via the autocovariance function,\nwhere the effect of event density and mean holding time are shown.",
