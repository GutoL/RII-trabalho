    "paper_abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a novel OTSS-assisted optical network architecture\nfor smart-grid communication networks, which has unique requirements for\nlow-latency connections. Illustrative results show that, OTSS can provide\nextremely better performance in latency and blocking probability than\nconventional flexi-grid optical networks.",
