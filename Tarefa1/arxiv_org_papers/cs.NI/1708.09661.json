    "paper_abstract": "Billions of Machine Type Communication (MTC) devices are foreseen to be\ndeployed in next ten years and therefore potentially open a new market for next\ngeneration wireless network. However, MTC applications have different\ncharacteristics and requirements compared with the services provided by legacy\ncellular networks. For instance, an MTC device sporadically requires to\ntransmit a small data packet containing information generated by sensors. At\nthe same time, due to the massive deployment of MTC devices, it is inefficient\nto charge their batteries manually and thus a long battery life is required for\nMTC devices. In this sense, legacy networks designed to serve human-driven\ntraffics in real time can not support MTC efficiently. In order to improve the\navailability and battery life of MTC devices, context-aware device-to-device\n(D2D) communication is exploited in this paper. By applying D2D communication,\nsome MTC users can serve as relays for other MTC users who experience bad\nchannel conditions. Moreover, signaling schemes are also designed to enable the\ncollection of context information and support the proposed D2D communication\nscheme. Last but not least, a system level simulator is implemented to evaluate\nthe system performance of the proposed technologies and a large performance\ngain is shown by the numerical results.",
