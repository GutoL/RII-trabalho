    "paper_abstract": "Opportunistic networks (OppNets) are focused to exploit direct, localised\ncommunications which occur in a peer-to-peer manner mostly based on people's\nmovements and their contact durations. Therefore, the use of realistic mobility\nmodels is critical to evaluate the data dissemination in OppNets. One of the\nmobility models that is available in OMNeT++ which can be used to mimic human\nmovement patterns is Small Worlds in Motion (SWIM). The SWIM model is based on\nthe intuition that humans often visit nearby locations and if the visited\nlocation is far away, then it is probably due to the popularity of the\nlocation. As an alternative to mobility of a node, pairwise contact\nprobabilities are also used to evaluate the data dissemination in OppNets.\nPairwise contact probabilities can be used to predict that a node will be met\nby a particular node. These probabilities can be derived in many ways. One of\nthe ways is to calculate the average probability with which a node will meet\nanother particular node at any point of time. Another way is to calculate the\nprobability with which a node will meet another based on the time of day. The\nway of calculating pairwise contact probability depends on the scenario. In\nthis work, the pairwise contact probabilities obtained from the real traces are\nused to tune the parameters of the SWIM mobility model. The traces and the SWIM\nmodel are compared in terms of contact durations, inter-contact times and,\nnumber of pairwise contacts. How to decide SWIM parameters using real contact\ntraces are being addressed.",
